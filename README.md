# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Project Description

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players (or one player against the computer, if you decide to extend it) to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The user can click on the grid to place 'X' or 'O', and the game checks for a winner or draw after each move.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay:** Players take turns placing 'X' or 'O' on the grid.
- **Automatic winner detection:** The game automatically checks if there is a winner after each move based on predefined win patterns.
- **Game Reset:** There is a reset button that clears the grid and starts a new game.
- **Draw detection:** If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game will declare a draw.
- **Responsive design:** The game layout adjusts to various screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Click any of the boxes in the grid to make your move. Player 1 uses "O" and Player 2 uses "X".
2. **Turn-based play:** The game alternates between "O" and "X" for each click on the grid.
3. **Winner:** The game automatically detects if any player has won. A message will display the winner when a win pattern is matched.
4. **Draw:** If all boxes are filled and no winner is found, the game will display a draw message.
5. **New Game:** You can reset the game by clicking the "New Game" button.
